              question: "Do I need advanced tech skills or coding knowledge?",
              answer: "No. The IG Flow Protocol handles the heavy lifting for you. We set it up, walk you through it, and provide ongoing support so you can focus on coaching, not troubleshooting."

              question: "Will my DMs sound robotic or impersonal?",
              answer: "Not at all. Our approach prioritizes conversational flows that match your brand voice. This ensures your prospects feel heard and engaged, rather than spammed."
            },
            {
              question: "How does this differ from basic auto-DMs?",
              answer: "Unlike simple auto-responders, the IG Flow Protocol uses conditional logic to qualify leads, ask relevant questions, and guide the conversation toward booking a callâ€”providing real value, not just an auto-reply."
            },
            {
              question: "Is there a long-term commitment?",
              answer: "We offer flexible arrangements. If you don't see real client bookings by Day 30, you owe us nothing, so there's no risk in trying it out."
            },
            {
              question: "Will I lose control of my Instagram account?",
              answer: "No. You retain complete access and control over your account. Our protocol runs in the background to streamline your DMs, so you can jump in anytime."
