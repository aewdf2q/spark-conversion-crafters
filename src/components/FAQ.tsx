      question: "Do I need advanced tech skills or coding knowledge?",
      answer: "No. The IG Flow Protocol handles the heavy lifting for you. We set it up, walk you through it, and provide ongoing support so you can focus on coaching, not troubleshooting."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my DMs sound robotic or impersonal?",
      answer: "Not at all. Our approach prioritizes conversational flows that match your brand voice. This ensures your prospects feel heard and engaged, rather than spammed."
    },
    {
      question: "How does this differ from basic auto-DMs?",
      answer: "Unlike simple auto-responders, the IG Flow Protocol uses conditional logic to qualify leads, ask relevant questions, and guide the conversation toward booking a callâ€”providing real value, not just an auto-reply."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a long-term commitment?",
      answer: "We offer flexible arrangements. If you don't see real client bookings by Day 30, you owe us nothing, so there's no risk in trying it out."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I lose control of my Instagram account?",
      answer: "No. You retain complete access and control over your account. Our protocol runs in the background to streamline your DMs, so you can jump in anytime."
